%\subsection{Introduction} % Initial capital letter, then lower case. No full stop.
Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N$ be i.i.d. sampled from a spherical symmetric distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
The convex hull $H_N$ of these $N$ points are an interrupted research topic in stochastic and integral geometry
\cite{schneider2008stochastic}.
The main aim of this paper is to provide a integral formula for $\E[F_N]$, the expected value of the number of $d-1$ dimensional hyperplanes
of $H_N$,
and derive its asymptotic expression
for three kinds of distribution families. Furthermore, the estimation of $\E[F_N]$ is used to obtain the upper bound
of the probability $p_{n,d}$, another sample falls outside of the random convex hull. This probability can be used to
measure the interpolation ability of training data in machine learning
\cite{balestriero2021learning}.

The asymptotic expression of $\E[F_N]$ as $N\to \infty$
was studied firstly by R{\'e}nyi \cite{renyi1963konvexe}.
In his paper the distribution considered
is 2D standard gaussian or uniform distribution within a convex region with continuous curvature.
Later on, Carnal \cite{carnal1970konvexe} generalized R{\'e}nyi's work,
and studied general symmetric distribution in 2d,
and obtained the asymptotic expression of $\E[F_N]$
in three different distribution families.

For $d>2$, the breakthrough is made firstly by
Raynaud
\cite{raynaud1970enveloppe}.
He obtains the asymptotic formula for uniform distribution within a hyperball
and standard gaussian in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
Then Dwyer \cite{dwyer1991convex} obtains the order of $\E[F_N]$ about $N$
in three different distribution families.

However, the asymptotic formula of $\E[F_N]$ is generally unknown.
In our work, we obtain this formula by generalizing the Carnal's integral formula
of $H(x)=P(d_{12}\geq x)$ to higher dimensions in Section \ref{sec:int_f}.
Then we obtain the asymptotic
expression for $\E[F_N]$ in three different distribution families in Section \ref{sec:three_distriutions}.
Based on this result,
we discuss the condition when $p_{n,d}$ converges to zero as $N,d \to \infty$
in Section \ref{sec:sample_complexity}.
This condition is applied to explain some dimension explosion problems
in the field of machine learning.

Without specific mention, the $d$-dimensional distribution considered in this paper is spherically symmetric.
Below we define some notations which are to be used throughout this paper.
Let $F(x)=P(|X|\geq x)$ represents the probability that a random point lies outside
a d-sphere. $G(x)=P(X_1\geq x)$ is the one dimensional marginal distribution.
Let $d$ represents the distance from the origin to the random hyperplane, spanned by $X_1, \dots, X_d$.
In 2d, $d=d_{12}$, the distance to the random line passing $X_1, X_2$. $H(x)=P(d\geq x)$ is
the probability outside of the random hyperplane.
\section{Integral formula}\label{sec:int_f}
In 2d, the integral formula for $\E[F_N]$ is given as
\begin{align}
     \E[F_N] &= \binom{N}{2} \int_0^{+\infty} 
     \left[G(x)^{N-2} + (1-G(x))^{N-2} \right]|dH(x)| 
     \label{eq:E_F_N_2_d}
\end{align}
The integral formula of $\E[F_N]$ involves the function $G(x)$ and $H(x)$,
both of which can be expressed in term of $F(x)$:
\begin{align}
   G(x) &=\frac{1}{\pi} \arccos\frac{x}{y} |dF(y)| \\
     H(x) &= \frac{2}{\pi} \int_x^{\infty} \arccos \frac{x}{z} |d(F^2(z))|
     \label{eq:H_expression_2_dim}
\end{align}
For $d\geq 2$, the integral formula is generalized as
\begin{align}
     \E[F_N] &= \binom{N}{d} \int_0^{+\infty} 
     \left[G(x)^{N-d} + (1-G(x))^{N-d} \right]|dH(x)| 
     \label{eq:E_F_N_d}
\end{align}
Formula first appeared in the proof section of \cite{raynaud1970enveloppe}
and can further to generalized to contain other integrands \cite{barany2008random}.
Dwyer obtains the integral formula for $G(x)$ in $d\geq 2$ as:
\begin{align}
     G(x) & = \int_x^{+\infty} \kappa(\frac{x}{y}) |dF(y)|
\end{align}
where $\kappa(r)$ is the fraction of the surface area of a unit d-sphere
cut off by a plane at distance $r$ from the origin.

Our main theorem gives the integral formula for $H(x)$ in $d\geq 2$:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:H}
Define the auxiliary function $\kappa(x,y)$ and $K(x)$ as follows: 
     \begin{align}
          \kappa(x,y) & :=(1-\frac{x^2}{y^2})^{\frac{d-2}{2}}\\
          K(x) &:=P(\sqrt{X_1^2+X_2^2}>x)= \int_x^{+\infty} \kappa(x,y)|dF(y)|
      \end{align}
Then
\begin{equation}
     H(x) = \frac{2}{\pi}
     \int_x^{+\infty} \arccos\frac{x}{y}
     |d K^d(y)|\label{eq:H_expression_d_dim}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
It is easy to observe that \eqref{eq:H_expression_d_dim} reduces to 
\eqref{eq:H_expression_2_dim} when $d=2$.
For standard Gaussian distributions, $X_1, X_2$ are independent 1d
Gaussian, therefore $K(x) = e^{-x^2/2}$. In fact, $1-K(x)$ is the CDF of Rayleigh distribution.
The detailed proof of Theorem \ref{thm:H}
is provided in Appendix \ref{app:th}.

\section{Three distribution families}\label{sec:three_distriutions}
Notice that in \eqref{eq:E_F_N_2_d}, as $G(x)<\frac{1}{2}$ for $x>0$, the integration containing the
term $G(x)^{N-2}$ decays exponentially fast as $N\to \infty$.

\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:H}}\label{app:th}
\begin{lemma}
     Let $F_0$ represent the
probability that the distance from the origin to the straight line
$X_1X_2$ is larger than $x$. Then 
\begin{equation}
     F_0(x)=\frac{2\Gamma(\frac{d}{2})}
     {\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(\frac{d-1}{2})}
     \int_x^{+\infty} |dF(y)|
     \int_x^{y} |dF(z)|dz \int_{a_2/z}^{a_1 /z} (1-u^2)^{\frac{d-3}{2}}du
 \end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
     a_1 & =\frac{x^2}{y}+\sqrt{z^2-x^2}\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{y^2}} > 0 \\
a_2 & =\frac{x^2}{y}-\sqrt{z^2-x^2}\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{y^2}} < 0
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
Lemma gives the integral formula for $P(d_{12}\geq x)$ in $\R^d$.
The geometric meaning of $a_1, |a_2|$ is illustrated in Figure
